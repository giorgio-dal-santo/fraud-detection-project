# Creation of a NoSQL Database for Credit Card Fraud Detection
New generation data models and DBMSs project

## Todo:
- generate 3 dataset (at least 1000 customers and 200 terminals):
    - Dataset 1: ≥ 50 MB
    - Dataset 2: ≥ 100 MB
    - Dataset 3: ≥ 200 MB

- conceptual model
- logical model considering the workload (a, b, c)
- script to load datasets into NoSQL
- implement script for required operations (a, b, c)
- extended logical model: 
    - new info for transaction:
        - payment method: credit card / mobile payment / paypal
        - promotional offer: yes / no
        - customer’s satisfaction: 1…5 (integer)
    - frequent collaborators

- for each day of the week:
    - total number of transactions
    - proportion of outlier transactions

- performance evaluation for all operations
